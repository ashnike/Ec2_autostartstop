# AWS EC2 Instance Management with AWS Lambda
This repository contains code examples and resources for automating the management of EC2 instances on AWS using AWS Lambda functions.

## Overview
Managing EC2 instances manually can be time-consuming and prone to human error. By leveraging AWS Lambda, you can automate the process of starting and stopping EC2 instances based on specific tags. Additionally, you can integrate notifications via AWS SNS to stay informed about the status of your instances.

## Contents
Lambda Functions: Contains Python code for Lambda functions to start and stop EC2 instances.
IAM Policy: JSON file defining the IAM policy required for Lambda functions.
Tutorial: Step-by-step guide on setting up and using Lambda functions for EC2 instance management.
To get started with EC2 instance management automation:

### Set up AWS Lambda functions by copying the code from the repository.
Create an IAM policy with permissions defined in iam_policy.json and attach it to the Lambda execution role.
Follow the tutorial in tutorial.md for step-by-step instructions on setting up and using Lambda functions.
